# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan approval status using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about various loan applicants, and the goal is to use this data to build a model that can predict whether a loan should be approved or not.

## Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset, handle missing values, and convert data types where necessary.
2. **Model Selection**: Use various machine learning models like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, and Naive Bayes to predict loan approvals.
3. **Evaluation**: Compare model performance and select the best one based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Export Results**: Generate a CSV file containing actual loan statuses alongside predicted values for further analysis.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handle missing values for both numeric and categorical data.
   - Ensure proper data types are used for each column.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transform categorical features and apply encoding methods.
   - Analyze feature importance and correlation.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train various classification models to predict loan approvals.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use a test set to evaluate model performance.
   - Compare models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Exporting Results**:
   - Combine the actual loan status with predicted values and export the results as a CSV file for further insights.

## Models Used

- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- AdaBoost
- Naive Bayes

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict loan approvals. The results provide insights into which factors are most important for loan approval and help automate decision-making.
